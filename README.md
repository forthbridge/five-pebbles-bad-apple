# Credits
As the first mod I have ever made for Rain World, you are legally not allowed to judge this code!

Seriously though, it's not pretty, but huge thanks to those who helped me on the RW Discord, especially Slime_Cubed and Wack for showing me how to play audio!

Woultkolkman's FivePebblesPong mod was used as a reference for a large part of this mod, so huge thanks to them too!

Please check out their mod, which is much cleaner and more technically impressive than this one:

# Usage
On Survivor / Monk, the pearl will be in Pebbles' chamber on entering, so the video sequence will start playing immediately!
This also means Pebbles will always kill you... 

On Hunter, the pearl will be in Hunter's stomach from the start - the video will begin playing when you enter the chamber with the pearl in hand!

BEWARE! It seems there is a memory leak problem with the audio player, so playing the video more than 2 times after launching the game may or may not crash the game with an 'out of memory' exception! Sometimes it's fine, sometimes it's not!
